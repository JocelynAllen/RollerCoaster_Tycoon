Rollercoaster Tycoon

I love the game RollerCoaster Tycoon; so I figured I would do a data project around
the game and answer questions about the game. 

* MySQL, Python, Tableau

Steps: 
1) Downloaded RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 data from Kaggle provided by Nolan Conway.
(https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/rollercoaster-tycoon-rides/metadata)

2) Created a csv dataset from the RollerCoaster 3 Tycoon Platinum game.

3) Formatted the RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 data using SQL to include the excitment, 
nausea, and intensity rating by low, medium, high, and very high.
